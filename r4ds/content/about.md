This is the website for the **Introduction to data science in R (2.9)** course at the [**University of Luxembourg**](http://uni.lu/).



Instructors for this class are:

 - **Pedro Cardoso-Leite**: ATTRACT Fellow (ass. Prof)
 - **Brice Clocher**: Game Designer & Developer




### Course Description
Data science is about transforming raw data into understanding. It involves activities such as pre-processing and documenting data, computing summary statistics, plotting meaningful relationships and writing reports.


This course is designed to help you get started in data science using R and give you the tools to further progress autonomously in the future.


This course will offer students access to high-quality online videos and interactive exercises via [datacamp.com](http://datacamp.com). In parallel to these at self-paced lectures at home we will organise hands-on workshops to put your newly acquired knowledge into practice with concrete and relevant use cases. Students will work in small groups to address data-science related challenges in several projects. Groups may also suggest projects on their own.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, the student should be able to program in R, be familiar with the main steps of a typical data science workflow and be able to find help when encountering new data science related problems.
