## Course Description
Data science is about transforming raw data into understanding. It involves activities such as preprocessing and documenting data, computing summary statistics, plotting meaningful relationships and writing reports.

This course is designed to help you get started in data science using R and give you the tools to further progress autonomously in the future.

Students will be able to access high-quality online videos and interactive exercises (via datacamp.com) for the duration of the course. In parallel to these self-paced lectures at home, we will organize hands-on workshops to put your newly acquired knowledge into practice with concrete and relevant use cases.

Although we welcome all levels, this course will focus on students who begin with R. Students with previous experience of R or data science, are advised to seek attendance to course “Data Science in R: Projects” instead.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, the student should be able to program in R, be familiar with the main steps of a typical data science workflow and be able to find help when encountering new data science related problems. Particularly, the student will be acquainted with community-standard tools for visualization, data tidying and transformation, modeling, reporting, and collaboration.

## Special Thanks
We wish to thank [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) for supporting this course.
