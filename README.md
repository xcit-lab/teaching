# Introduction to Data Science in R 

## Course Description
Data science is about transforming raw data into understanding. It involves activities such as  pre-processing and documenting data, computing summary statistics, plotting meaningful relationships and writing reports. 
 
This course is designed to help you get started in data science using R and give you the tools to further progress autonomously in the future.  
 
This course will offer students access to high-quality online videos and interactive exercises (via datacamp.com). In parallel to these at self-paced lectures at home we will organise hands-on workshops to put your newly acquired knowledge into practice with concrete and relevant use cases. Students will work in small groups to address data-science related challenges in several projects. Groups may also suggest projects on their own. 

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, the student should be able to program in R, be familiar with the main steps of a typical data science workflow and be able to find help when encountering new data science related problems.
